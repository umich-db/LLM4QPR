# Query Plans Data

This folder contains the pre-generated query plans used in the LLM4QPR experiments.

Due to size constraints (1.42 GB), the query plans are hosted externally:

**Google Drive**: [Download queryPlans.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnto7FilrTMu7ugOKG0mgRG220Y4SVYV/view?usp=drive_link)

## Usage

2. Extract it to this directory (`LLM4QPR/queryPlans/`)
3. The extracted folder should contain subdirectories for each dataset:
   - `tpch/`
   - `tpcds/`
   - `imdb/`
   - `stats/`
